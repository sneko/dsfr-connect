// Since basic theme uses `darken()` and `lighten()` and we don't want to override all occurences
// because it would make things really complex, we override the old functions definitions to adjust depending
// on light or dark theme
//
// Note: for now we are fine since they do not use new SASS module with `color.adjust()` as below, otherwise there
// is no longer a way to override by default (https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/#darken)
